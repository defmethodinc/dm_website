## Study Group Expanded: 18 December 2014

*Every week I run the [Ruby on Rails Study Group](https://generalassemb.ly/education/ruby-on-rails-study-group/new-york-city/10792) for General Assembly. The sessions themselves are restricted to GA alumni, but I like to share what we learn with everyone!*

Here's what happened at the last Ruby Study Group:

- We looked at a recent [post by Justin Weiss](http://www.justinweiss.com/blog/2014/12/16/where-do-you-put-your-code/?utm_source=rubyweekly&utm_medium=email) that answers the question: Where do I put my code in a Rails app?

- We had a discussion about [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) and why it's important. We can take advantage of SemVer in our Rails apps by using a [pessimistic versioning scheme](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/rubys-pessimistic-operator) in our Gemfile. Finally, [Gemnasium](https://gemnasium.com/) is a service that inspects your Gemfile and alerts you to gems that are out-of-date.

- We had a brief discussion of design patterns. We started with a discussion of the [Gang of Four book](https://books.google.com/books?id=6oHuKQe3TjQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=gang+of+four+design+patterns&hl=en&sa=X&ei=WjWYVIXJIObZsATdw4LwCg&ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false), which first popularized the use of design patterns. We discussed a [few popular patterns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoEaAznXogs) and one reasonably good [attempt in book-form](http://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Ruby-Russ-Olsen/dp/0321490452) to discuss how they apply to Ruby.

- We discussed the different [Devise helper methods](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise#controller-filters-and-helpers) that we can use in our controllers and (if we must) in our views. We also talked about redirection after sign-in, the many forms this can take, and how to [implement it assuming Rails and Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/wiki/How-To:-redirect-to-a-specific-page-on-successful-sign-in).

Happy Hacking!
