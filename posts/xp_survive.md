## Why I Want XP NYC to Survive
- October 8, 2014

*TLDR; you should join XP NYC and help us make it great again: www.meetup.com/xp-26.*

When I received an email stating that the XP NYC Meetup was going to close it's doors, I responded right away. At first I wasn't sure why I did it - it was almost instinctive. But I understand now that XP NYC is representative of all of those great XP and Agile SIGs I had the benefit of joining and attending early in my career. I believe there's still a place for XP NYC and that it can still thrive among all of the other meetups and commitments that vie for our limited free time.

I have beeen using XP principles to develop software in New York City for the past 10 years. I've come to believe that the surest path to success in our field is in building a strong community of passionate, like-minded enthusiasts. At one time, before there was a meetup.com, XP meetups were the surest way to find those kindred spirits in the software industry. I believe XP NYC can be that place once again for everyone interested in discovering, promoting, and delivering superior methods of technical execution to an industry that needs them now more than ever.

First, I want to know how much interest there is in keeping this Meetup running. XP NYC hasn't met in awhile. We have almost 700 members comprised of engineers, entrepreneurs, managers, and innovators and I know that we're all out in the world practicing and preaching XP principles. For many of us, learning XP was a defining moment in our careers. XP NYC is a place that we can come and learn from each other, get a better understanding of how XP and Agile apply in our working lives, and become catalysts for the evolution of software development.

I think this is a great thing, and I'd like to see this meetup flourish. If you agree, then great! I could really use your help! [Join us](www.meetup.com/xp-26) and lend a hand with:

- Speakers. Anyone interested in giving a talk, please contact me.
- Topics and Meetup suggestions. If you're interested attending, let me know what you'd like to see. What do you want to discuss? What kind of meeting format is most effective for you?
- Space. We'll need a meeting space with presentation equipment on a monthly basis.
- Opinions. If you can think of other ways to contribute, including offering advice, I'm really interested in hearing from you!
